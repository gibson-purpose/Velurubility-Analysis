# Velurubility-Analysis

Malicious software aka Malware is one of the
stern threats that has been around ever since the computers
were developed. Malware is designed by malicious attackers
whose intension is to bring down the system or to take over the
system. It is very difficult to detect unknown malware as
compared to known ones. Steganography tools allow users for
embedding the hidden data inside the carrier file like video,
audio, or an image, and later data is extracted. Here, malware
is hidden inside an image by attackers to manipulate the
victims and it can be done via phishing technique which is one
of the famous and well-known practices done by the attackers.
This paper provides an overview of creating malware using
Metasploit in the Parrot OS (Operating System) which is a
secure OS, later the Steganography tool is used to manipulate
the victim and the victimâ€™s system is taken over by the
attacker. Also, a summarized analysis is given on the Open
Source Intelligence Tools (OSINT) and which one gives the
best results.
